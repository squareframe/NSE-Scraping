    "### Problem Statement: Automated Web Scraping of Financial Data from NSE India Website\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description: \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to develop an automated web scraping solution using Selenium to extract financial data from the NSE India website (https://www.nseindia.com/). The program should fetch a list of companies alphabetically, navigate to each company's page, and scrape specific financial information, including Total Income, Profit Before Tax, and Net Profit/Loss for the quarter ended on 31 March 2023. The scraped data should be stored in a CSV file for further analysis. The solution should also incorporate a mechanism to resume scraping from where it left off to avoid duplicating data if the program is run multiple times. The project aims to provide a reliable and efficient way to gather financial data for analysis and decision-making purposes\n",

The code navigates to the company's page, selects the \"Corporate Information\" tab, and clicks on the \"Financial Results\" navigation bar. It verifies if the desired financial quarter (31 Mar 2023) is available and if so, extracts the Total Income, Profit Before Tax, and Net Profit/Loss. The scraped data is stored in a CSV file for further analysis. Additionally, the code includes a condition to continue from where it left off if the program is run again, ensuring that duplicate data is not collected. This solution provides an efficient and automated way to gather financial information from the NSE India website."
